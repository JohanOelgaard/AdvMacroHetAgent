# Assignment II

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [HANCWelfareModel.ipynb](HANCWelfareModel.ipynb) â€“ be aware that I nummerically optimize 4 different implementations of the tax changes, which makes the last part of the notebook take a while to run.
Answers to the questions are can be found in the file [Assignment_II](Assignment_II.pdf).
